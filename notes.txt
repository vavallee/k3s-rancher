# Raspberry Pi Kubernetes Consolidation Project

# Hardware
# 3x Raspberry PI 4 Model B w/ 8GB RAM (https://www.eurekatec.ca/product/raspberry-pi-4-model-b-standalone-board/884?cp=true&sa=false&sbp=false&q=false&category_id=23)

# 1x Rasperry Pi Cluster Case with fans (https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B07MW3GM1T?ref=ppx_pt2_dt_b_prod_image)
# 1x USB-C Power Cables (https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B07KFX18KJ?ref=ppx_pt2_dt_b_prod_image)
#  3x 64 Gb Gigastone A2 SDXC Class 10 Cards (https://www.amazon.ca/Gigastone-MicroSD-Adapter-Dashcam-Nintendo/dp/B01MRSY5SJ)
# NOTE on ABOVE: These SD cards are A2V30, not just class 10. Normal Class 10 SDcards have too slow a write speed, and you will run into bottlenecks



# Steps
# Install 64 bit Ubuntu 20.04.1 (ubuntu-20.04.1-preinstalled-server-arm64+raspi.img) to the SD Cards
# Build your case, put the heatsinks on, insert your SD cards, connect ethernet, power on your cluster
# foreach RPI
# ssh to the node, and either leave them with DHCP (recommend static DHCP in your router)
# I set manual IP addresses becasue the cluster runs my DHCP server (catch 22)
# set CGROUPS
vi /boot/firmware/cmdline.txt
# Paste "cgroup_enable=cpuset cgroup_enable=memory cgroup_memory=1" to the end of the line and save the file
# set hostnames
hostnamectl set-hostname k8s1
hostnamectl set-hostname k8s2
hostnamectl set-hostname k8s3
# install net-tools
apt install net-tools

# Reboot all nodes.

# Then get the node key

# UPGRADE NOTES
# When you upgrade the cluster, you need the below syntax (for Latest not Stable)
# I've had some broken upgrades in the past, so for now I take an image of the server sdcard before upgrade to be safe
# Note: Nov 2021: All the metalLB IP addresses seem to get reset, so check those out to see that they match with the DNS
# If you upgrade to k3s 1.22+ versions, note that ingress is deprecated, if you have had traefik enabled in 1.21 it will not update to v2 which is needed for non-ingress
# kubernetes. In my case, I used --disable traefik in the k3s master and installed it seperately and rebuilt my ingress as load balancers and ingressroutes.
# Details here: https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/user-guides/crd-acme/
